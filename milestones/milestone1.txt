### 1.Executive Summary: (Robin)

Student Swap is an online marketplace built specifically for San Francisco State University students. Users will be able to buy, sell, or trade goods and services that relate closely to the needs of college students. Our service takes a hyper-local approach to online commerce - users will be engaging with others that are often within walking distance of one another. They use the same textbooks year over year, have the same sized dorm rooms (meaning they need the same size couches), and have taken the same classes, allowing some users to monetize their knowledge by offering tutoring or homework help. A user will often find a textbook from someone who lives in the same building, allowing them to effortlessly pick up their purchase. A graduating senior will easily find a buyer for their now unneeded dorm furniture, since incoming freshmen will be in need of the same kinds of products. Student Swap leverages this interconnectivity as a competitive advantage over other online marketplaces (such as Amazon), where you often have to pay for shipping and charges introduced by the middleman.
Student Swap offers a few additional features that simplifies shopping and engages users to return to the site in the future. Users can browse for items or services they are in need of, and post “wanted” ads for those things that aren’t yet available for sale. Buyers and sellers can contact each other directly tem oto communicate about the ir service, and bookmark posts to return to later while they’re waiting for a response. Since all of our users are San Francisco State University students (or faculty), they all either live close to each other or attend classes on campus - putting them close enough to engage with each other in established “meet-up spots” on or near campus.
Student Swap’s greatest strength is the tight focus we gain by having users with similar needs and close proximity. Our product will further leverage these advantages with a simple and robust user experience, inexpensive direct marketing, and by offering a place to trade niche items and services unique to the needs of an SFSU student.


###2. Use Cases: (Avery)

####Case 1: Karen (Unregistered Guest)
Karen is a  San Francisco State University (SFSU) student new to college life as a freshman. She is renting around an apartment at ParkMerced and is looking to find some furniture. She decides to try out the new “students only” website after seeing a marketing flyer on a local bulletin board. After going online and navigating to the site, she browses through the homepage where some featured items are displayed. She decides to narrow her search in the furniture category. She browses through the furniture, noting the date posted, seller rating, and the image of each item. 
As she shops, clicking on each of them she is able to proceed to the item’s page to look up the details such as date posted, the description, price, and condition of the item, as well as a map to where she can pick up the item around campus.  She finds something she likes and adds it to the shopping cart. The shopping cart takes her to a page that shows any items she’s decided to buy in current or past sessions (that she has not already purchased). She decides to purchase, and is asked if she’d like to have them delivered to her for an additional fee. She decides to have it delivered to her apartment since it is too heavy for her to transport on her own. She then proceeds to checkout where she is prompted to login to her account or sign up for the first time with her SFSU email. 

####Case 2: Tom (Member)
	Tom is a registered student of the SFSU who has used Student Swap as a buyer and seller in the past. Today, Tom is looking for a used textbook for a course offered at SFSU, but is not offered at many other schools. Knowing that he will have a difficult time finding it in a store, and not finding it on Amazon, he navigates to Student Swap where he had placed a wanted post indicating he is looking for an unlisted item. He checks his notifications box to see if anyone had offered the textbook for sale since he last checked, but no one has listed anything. He needs the book for a class later, so he decides to search for an older version. He navigates to the textbook category and scrolls around where he finds a few entries for the book, listed for sale by different students.  He reviews the condition of each book via the images in each entry, takes note of the seller rating, and uses the contact feature to message one seller to inquire whether they live within the same building as Tom (making it very easy for Tom to pick up the book). He adds that and other options to his wishlist so he can quickly return to them later.

####Case 3: Harry (Administrator)

	Harry is an administrator for Student Swap and has come to his weekly check in to review both flags of the site and checked the notifications box and noticed a few cases. As an administrator, he cannot buy or sell, so his inbox contains only cases. He notices a case in which a user was flagged for his comment on another user’s review. Clicking the flag link, he is instantly able to review the comment and either contact the user or mark the comment for deletion. Another user has been flagged for review for suspicion of wrongful activity. He reviews the user’s history and determines that the user’s behavior is in violation of the Terms of Use. He decides to suspend the account, disabling access. The user can appeal Harry or another administrator to review the action - either confirming or reverting the account status.

Student Swap has two clear advantages over competitor sites. One is the hyper-local focus that allows students to quickly and easily buy and sell to other SFSU students without needing to browse and parse large lists of information, or to deal with shipping and handling. The other is the ability to offer services and other product types outside of textbooks. This facilitates the exchange of other items or services that are key to the target demographic, like tutoring or dorm furniture.
